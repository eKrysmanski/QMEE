#Try something simple to begin with; determine what  proteins that are more

# work from.

#I want to calculate the ratios and t-tests myself so I won't worry about those
#Used AI to troubleshoot, was directed to use "Across". I think what was happening was
# mutate() expects mutate(new column = expression), and I'm giving it multiple
# columns?

#Creating summary data.frame -- calculate the mean FC, and perform t-tests on

#Note: the t-test here assumes unequal variance, and is a single-tailed t-test, 
# since I'm specifically interested inif protiens are more abundant rather than 
# just differentially abundant in the SAR vs. mock. If I want to also check for 
# less abundant I would need to adjust this to a two-tailed test because I think it 
# is an error to perform  multiple statistical tests on the same data... I think...
# Perhaps I need to consult someone who knows this stuff better.

# to apply a function across multiple columns per row, like calculating the mean of 3 columns for each row
# in my case.
